              Known as “the cradle of mankind,” Kenya has no single culture that
              identifies it. There are about 40 different ethnic groups in
              Kenya, each with its unique culture. As a result, there is no
              single dish that represents all of Kenya. The staple foods in
              Kenya include cereals (maize, millet, sorghum and others depending
              on the region) eaten with various meats and vegetables. Foods that
              are universally eaten in Kenya are ugali, sukuma wiki and githeri.

            <p>
              Cuisine of the Maghreb countries, Algerian cuisine, Moroccan
              cuisine and Tunisian cuisine. North Africa borders the
              Mediterranean Sea and includes Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia,
              Mauritania and Egypt. This region is marked by its geographical,
              political, social, economic and cultural diversity. The cuisine,
              culinary style and art of North Africa are as diverse as its
              regions, peoples and history. The roots of North African cuisine
              can be traced back to the ancient empires of North Africa,
              particularly Egypt, where many of the country's dishes and
              culinary traditions date back to antiquity. From the seventh
              century, the Arabs introduced a variety of spices, such as
              saffron, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger and cloves, which contributed to
              and influenced the culinary culture of North Africa. The Ottoman
              Turks brought pastries and other baked goods.

            <h1>Central African food</h1>
            <p>
              Central Africa stretches from the Tibesti massif in northern Chad
              to the great rainforest at the source of the Congo Basin, the Kivu
              highlands and the Katanga savannahs. This region has received
              several culinary influences. The Swahili (a culture that evolved
              In the western region, especially in the Kongo Kingdom, there was
              a Portuguese culinary influence. An example of this is the salted
              fish called makayabu from the Portuguese word Bacalhau
              (bal-ca-ya-hu). These foods have had a great influence on local
              cuisine and preparation methods. Nevertheless, the culinary
              influence found in Central Africa is also transcontinental.
              Central Africa shares several dishes with other African regions
              because of their proximity. Ntaba (goat) or lamb) in barbecue
              style with chikwangue and chilli dust The basic ingredients are
              plantains, cassava, chikwangue and rice. Fufu, a starch-based
              dish, is most often made from fermented cassava roots, but also
              includes plantains, maize and yam. Fufu is served as a buffet with
              meat and/or fish, sauces, vegetables and chilli.

            <h1>Kenyan food</h1>
            <p>
              Kenyan cuisine is very varied and differs from one region (natural
              resources) and especially from one ethnic group (traditions) to
              another. There are however two common culinary preparations: Ugali
              (a word of Swahili origin). It can be made only with white maize
              (mahindi in Swahili) or with sorghum (mtama in Swahili). Githeri
              (a word of Kikuyu origin), which is a mixture of maize grains and
              beans. This mixture may or may not be accompanied by other
              vegetables, depending on the tribal origin. Nshima, a maize-based
              dish mixed with vegetables and meat (or fish), is also sometimes
              eaten. The side dishes may consist of ugali (also called kwon in
              Luo) made of yellow or white maize with either sukuma wiki (which
              currently means "a dish of cabbage" but is a misnomer; in Swahili,
              sukuma means to grow and wiki means week. Originally, therefore,
              it meant "the art of preparing leftovers") or of scalded and
              browned alot bo or kunde leaves (in Luo or Swahili). Chapati (in
              Swahili) with dengu (in Swahili) or other oganda or maharagwe
              ('beans' in Luo or Swahili). Kachumbari ("tomato, onion and
              coriander salad with varying degrees of spice" in Swahili).
              Plantain or sweet potato. Okra (cooked in a tomato sauce or mixed
              with sukuma wiki or alot bo). Apoth ("slippery vegetable" in Luo),
              which is the leaf of a wild herb that tastes like okra. Everything
              can be washed down with a local beer (Tusker or Senator) or palm
              wine.
